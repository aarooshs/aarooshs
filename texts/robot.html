    Atlas, team 2854’s 15th robot, was built to compete in FRC 2024’s game Crescendo. Through collaboration,
    communication, and innovation, students are empowered to learn skills and combine their ideas and innovations with
    engineering and design, while practicing gracious professionalism. The game is themed around music, involving two
    alliances consisting of three teams collaborating and competing with each other to perform various tasks, including
    scoring foam rings, called Notes, into goals at the end of the field. At the end of the 2 minute matches, the
    objective is for the robots to climb on metal chains on the stage to earn additional points. The game’s kickoff
    event occurred on January 6, 2024.
