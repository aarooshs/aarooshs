    The game is themed around music, involving two alliances consisting of three teams collaborating and competing with
    each other to perform various tasks, including scoring foam rings, called Notes, into goals at the end of the field.
    At the end of the 2 minute matches, the objective is for the robots to climb on metal chains on the stage to earn
    additional points. The gameâ€™s kickoff event occurred on January 6, 2024.
