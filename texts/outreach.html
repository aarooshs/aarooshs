    As a 100% student-led public school team, we have built up our team and thrived with the guidance and support of
    veteran teams. Using our unique skill sets from founding our team from scratch, we wanted to share and create the
    same life-changing opportunities for other local and international teams and communities where we could make a
    difference, so we heavily focused our outreach on mentorship.

    In the last couple of seasons, we have created four branches of outreach: FIRST outreach, Women in STEM outreach,
    community outreach, and Corporate Connections outreach.
