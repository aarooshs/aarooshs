    Founded in 2009 with limited resources and no experience whatsoever, the Prototypes tackled the challenge and took
    their robot to the Sacramento Regionals. Against all odds, the Prototypes were given the “Rookie Inspiration Award”
    and attained the highest rookie seed. The Prototypes experienced impediments throughout the years through rough
    transitions in leadership and lost knowledge. Now, the Prototypes continue to foster excellence by
    exposing their campus to the ingenuity of FIRST. The Prototypes hope to gain and teach
    members the fundamentals of robotics through workshops and outreaches and ultimately have fun throughout the
    seasons.
